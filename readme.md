An eclipse occurs when three celestial objects become aligned.

From the perspective of a person on Earth, the Sun is eclipsed when the Moon comes between it and Earth, and the Moon is eclipsed when it moves into the shadow of Earth cast by the Sun. Eclipses of natural satellites (moons) or of spacecraft orbiting or flying past a planet occur as the bodies move into the planetâ€™s shadow. 

The two component stars of an eclipsing binary star move around each other in such a way that their orbital plane passes through or very near Earth, and each star periodically eclipses the other as seen from Earth.

Depending on how the body has covered the path of the other two bodies there are three main ways of eclipses. 
They are:
1.Total eclipse
2.partial eclipse
3.annular eclipse

In total eclipse the moon completely covers the path of the sun and earth and hence we can see nothing 
In partial eclipse the moon only partially covers the sun .
In annular we  can see a ring of fire around the moon .
